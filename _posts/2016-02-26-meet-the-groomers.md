I'm a pet groomer and founder of "The Grooming Table". 

This company my little way of giving back what animals and nature

Pet groomers tend to be stressed up by the sheer amount of work every day and animals will pick up on the negative vibes and get affected as well, creating a vicious cycle. That's why I prefer not to rush through during grooming, giving your pets' time to adapt to the process, which means less stress and longer lives for all of us.

I didn't have a pet when I started grooming and in fact, I was terrified of them. But I started interacting with animals and I guess that was when the magic started. After becoming a groomer though, I realized that there are so much more that that needs to be done, especially on animal well-being and owner education. I want to be the one educating owners and helping you realize the potential and satisfaction of having well balanced and healthy pet.

It has been really rewarding having happy customers and because of that, trust me that I will continue to provide services to the best of my abilities.

In my free time, I enjoy reading Manga and watching Anime. Yes, anything Japanese.

I own a poodle named "Banana" who has been a big part of my life and my grooming journey.

I'm a pet groomer and co-founder at The Grooming Table and when I'm not grooming, I'm responsible for the marketing of the company.

The reason for me joining the pet industry was because of my first dog I had back when I was 14 years old and the dogs I have now, for their unconditional love theyhasgiven me and my family. My conviction grew deep after working in this industry, witnessing how pets can be better-taken care of and how systems in this society can be improved.

When I'm not at work, I enjoy reading on various subjects including health, finance, business, personal development and random things that fascinate me.

Other than that, I enjoy spending quiet days with my girlfriend wife, Peiwen, feasting on ramen,BBQand simple local food.

Adopted a Yorkshire terrier from a kind friend and recently an old Maltese (RIP KBB 2015 Sept 12).
